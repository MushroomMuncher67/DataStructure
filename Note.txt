DSA Prelim Exam Note:

(DONE)1. Create an integer array, composing of 10 elements, with values ranging from 20 to 60 (Unsorted Values)
Then display the array using forloop.

Unsorted Values : 25 21 45 44 30 23 50 35 56 60

(DONE)2. Create a stack and queue that stores the content of the initial array (We're using insert here)
Then pop 3 times on both stacks,
then display the content of the stack and queue.

(DONE)3. Combine the content of stack and queue into 1 container, then display/insert the stack first then the queue
call it data merging and print the result to an array.

(DONE)4. Create 4 sorting algorithm functions that we can call/refer to, that can apply onto an array.

(DONE)5. Use chrono function, between running the 4 sorting algorithms, monitor/estimate the time complexity of every 
sorting algorithm when running. (microseconds)

Then make a conclusion for which one is the ideal algorithm.

Thanks co-pilot!!!
